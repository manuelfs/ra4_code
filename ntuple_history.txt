2015-07-22, quick:
  - Added triggers and JSON for data
  - Changed signal muon ID to Medium, veto to Loose
  - Most MC is Spring15 with cfA v80
  - Added mumu_m and elel_m with the dilepton invariant mass
  - Added online HT, MET, lepton pT

2015-05-25, quick:
  - Lowered jet pT threshold to 30 GeV for HT, njets, nb
  - Added ht40, njets40, nb[t,m,l]40 variables
  - Changed MJ eta threshold to 2.5 and removed pT > 50 GeV threshold
  - All jets associated with signal leptons are included in MJ

2015-05-21, quick:
  - Updated electron ID to the May 7th Egamma POG recommendation. It kills ~4% of good electrons...
  - For non-PF leptons, don't skip pfcands in the miniso calculation. It kills ~20% of good non-PF
    electrons, a small fraction of the total.
  - Added variables for R=0.8 jet clustering
  - Added ntks_chg with number of tracks that pass the proposed track veto
  - Added ntruleps, ntrumus, ntruels, ntrutaush, ntrutausl

2015-05-18: DO NOT USE!!! MERGED into 2015-05-15
  -Rerun single top s-channel to fix incorrect negative weights in samples split over multiple batch jobs
  -Merged into 2015-05-15

2015-05-15: DO NOT USE!!!
  -"Full" ntuples for all samples including negative weights
  -Single top s-channel remade 5-18 due to bug in negative weight handling when sample needs multiple batch jobs
  -All weights incorrect for samples split into multiple batch jobs. 

2015-05-12: MERGED into 2015-05-10
  -Rerun single top in "quick" mode to fix negative weights; merged into 2015-05-10
  -Merged into 5-10

2015-05-10, full [quick for single t] [tag says "quick" incorrectly]:
  -Synchronized trees with Stu-tuples (stuples?)
  -Single top remade 5-12 to include negative weights
