  - Updated electron ID to the May 7th Egamma POG recommendation. It kills ~4% of good electrons...
  - For non-PF leptons, don't skip pfcands in the miniso calculation. It kills ~20% of good non-PF
    electrons, a small fraction of the total.
  - Apply new JEC also to MET
  - Added ntks_chg with number of tracks that pass the proposed track veto
  - Added ntruleps, ntrumus, ntruels, ntrutaush, ntrutausl

2015-05-18:
  -Rerun single top s-channel to fix incorrect negative weights in samples split over multiple batch jobs
  -Merged into 2015-05-15

2015-05-15: DO NOT USE!!!
  -"Full" ntuples for all samples including negative weights
  -Single top s-channel remade 5-18 due to bug in negative weight handling when sample needs multiple batch jobs
  -All weights incorrect for samples split into multiple batch jobs. 

2015-05-12:
  -Rerun single top in "quick" mode to fix negative weights; merged into 2015-05-10
  -Merged into 5-10

2015-05-10:
  -Synchronized trees with Stu-tuples (stuples?)
  -Single top remade 5-12 to include negative weights
  -Only have "quick" format, not full
